Responsive Portfolio

This is my portfolio About Me, Stephanie Marie. 

I have created the following portfolio using Bootstrap CSS Framework in the following files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* I have used Bootstrap, and develop my own portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

   * All my links work.

* Used semantic html.

* My personalized information is included; bio, name, images, links to my personal email, etc.

*  I've utilize Bootstrap components and grid system. (containers, rows, and columns).

* The Bootstrap portfolio minimize and uses the media queries.









   



### Minimum Requirements

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Navbar must be consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* All links must work.

* Must use semantic html.

* Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

* Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.

* Use an HTML validation service to ensure that each page has valid HTML.

* On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.


### Bonus

* Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (**Hint:** Check out the Bootstrap documentation).
